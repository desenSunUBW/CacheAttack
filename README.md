# Attacks on Approximate Caches in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models
Three Attacks:
* Convert Channel
* Prompt Stealing
* Poison Attack

The embedding-2-prompt reversion model used in the experiment is uploaded to `https://huggingface.co/snownhonoka/attacks-on-approximate-caches-in-text_to_image-diffusion-models`, trained by using diffutiondb dataset. You can also trian your new one by using the training scripts provided in this repo.
